<h3>variables (and where they are used)</h3>

<p>
	Writing a gradle plugin that works and that can be tested easily requires a 
	few bits of knowledge to make the process seamless.  
</p>
<p>
	For your reference, the variables that are required on the command line are the 
	smallest subset of variables that you will need to generate the file.  
	<strong>You will most likely be required to update some of the files to ensure 
	that you create and publish your plugin correctly.</strong>
</p>

<h4><code>{{name}</code> and <code>{{lowerName}</code></h4>

<p>
	The <code>name</code> variable is used throughout most of the files - this is also 
	translated to <code>lowerName</code> by lowercasing the first letter of the <code>{{name}</code> 
	variable.  (i.e. <code>String lowerName = name.substring(0,1).toLowerCase() + name.substring(1);</code>)
</p>

<p>
	These variables are used in the following files, and for the following reasons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>{{artefact}.{{lowerName}.properties</code> file
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>{{lowername}</code> variable used to generate the file name</li>
			<li>The <code>{{name}</code> variable is used as a value for the <code>implementation-class</code> key in the properties file</li> 
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So, we created this scaffolding generator for gradle plugins in java!
</p>

<p>
	This project also provides the documentation, so that you understand what is 
	going on and are able to extend the plugin to do whatever you want it to.  
	Rather than building yet another plugin (which we wanted to), we decided to 
	build this plugin builder - as a way of sharing the knowledge of how to build 
	plugins, and as a final test - use it as a way to build the next plugin!
</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>
	To get started quickly you will need to download the jar from the 
	<a href="https://github.com/synapticloopltd/gradle-plugin-java-create/releases/">GitHub releases page</a>.  We 
	recommend that you get the latest release.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have downloaded the jar, try:
</p>

<pre><code>java -jar gradle-plugin-java-create-&lt;version&gt;-all.jar </code></pre>

<p>
	You will be presented with a <em>(hopefully)</em> helpful usage message:
</p>

<pre><code>
{pre
usage: gradle-plugin-java-create
 -a,--artefact &lt;arg&gt;   The artefact that this will be published under
                       (e.g. the github user/org name or the gradle
                       plugins username)
 -d,--desc &lt;arg&gt;       The description for the gradle plugin (free text
                       description)
 -g,--group &lt;arg&gt;      The group for the gradle plugin (the group that the
                       plugin will be listed under for 'gradle tasks')
 -n,--name &lt;arg&gt;       The name of the gradle plugin (java class name
                       CamelCase - __MUST__ not end in the word 'Plugin')
 -p,--package &lt;arg&gt;    The java package for the plugin (java dot '.'
                       delimited package name)

pre}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ALL</strong> options are required</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>
{pre
java -jar gradle-plugin-java-create-&lt;version&gt;-all.jar \
    -n TestSample \
    -g Sample \
    -a synapticloop \
    -p synapticloop.plugin.sample \
    -d "a simple test plugin"
pre}</code></pre>

<p>
	This will then generate the following files:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>./src/main/resources/META-INF/gradle-plugins/synapticloop.testSample.properties</code></dt>
	<dd>this file is used by the gradle system to identify that it is actually a gradle plugin and designates the plugin's implementation class.</dd>

	<dt><code>./src/main/java/synapticloop/plugin/sample/TestSamplePlugin.java</code></dt>
	<dd>This is the plugin file which registers the extension that the task relies on and the tasks that the plugin provides</dd>

	<dt><code>./src/main/java/synapticloop/plugin/sample/TestSamplePluginExtension.java</code></dt>
	<dd>This is the extension file which allows you to set variables or over-ride defaults for the task.</dd>

	<dt><code>./src/main/java/synapticloop/plugin/sample/TestSampleTask.java</code></dt>
	<dd>This is the task which does all of the work.</dd>

	<dt><code>./build.plugin.initial.gradle</code></dt>
	<dd>This is the initial build file which you may use to publish the plugin to the local maven repository for testing</dd>

	<dt><code>./build.plugin.gradle</code></dt>
	<dd>This is the testing gradle build file which allows you to test out iterations of the plugin using the local maven repository</dd>

</dl>
